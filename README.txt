    This is a personal project to increase my knowledge of fundamental sorting
algorithms as well as to improve my Java skills in general. The ten algorithms
I will implement are as follows:
    1.  Quick sort
    2.  Merge sort
    3.  Heap sort
    4.  Insertion sort
    5.  Selection sort
    6.  Bubble sort
    7.  Radix sort
    8.  Counting sort
    9.  Bucket sort
    10. Shell sort 
This is, by no means, an exhaustive list of all sorting algorithms. I simply
asked ChatGPT "What are the 10 most important sorting algorithms to learn?"
on May 21st, 2023 (5/21/23). This list is approximately what I have already
learned and expected, with the addition of radix, bucket, and shell sort.
As a result, I trusted it as a sufficient result, and it saved me a lot of
time trying to compile a 'fundamental' set of sorting algorithms.

To run all the sorting algorithms, you need the java jdk installed and
configured (it should depend on no specific version, but I used the RedHat
openjdk 17) navigate to the directory `sorting-algorithms-java` and run the
following command:
    > java SortingAlgorithms.java
